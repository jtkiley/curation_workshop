2. Convert it (into csv?)
3. Merge with Compustat(?) – or look at charts, pre-post Bitcoin drop
4. Create a Pandas dataframe

6. Use text blob to run a basic count / analysis
7. Visualize it
* Reflections
o Does what we’ve presented seem doable?
o Other questions, concerns?
o How might you use this approach & workflow in your own research?
* Conclusion
o Parting words form presenters: next steps for participants
